PR #8 (Refactor marketing pages to use GlossyPageShell component system)

This PR intentionally refactors all marketing pages (src/app/(marketing)/),
the homepage (src/app/page.tsx), and admin shell components to use the new
unified GlossyPageShell component system. These changes are reviewed and
approved as part of the planned marketing page consolidation.

Protected paths modified:
- src/app/(marketing)/ — all marketing pages converted to GlossyPageShell
- src/app/page.tsx — homepage rewritten with feature list and workflow
- src/app/_client/ — AdminShellClient updated to use new icon system
